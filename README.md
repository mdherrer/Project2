# Project2

## Scientific Question: 
### Is it possible to predict and further prevent the next influenza epidemic by looking at seasonal flu strains (that have a potential to become pandemic) genomic profile and features, and comparing them to those of previous pandemic flu strains?

### Scientific Hypothesis:
#### If big deadly Influenza epidemics have happened around every 10-40 years, and the last epidemic was 2009 H1N1 epidemic, then the 1918 influenza strain will have extremely similar or identical HA and NA glycoprotein features to the 2009 strain, which in turn are more genetically related to the current seasonal influenza strains.

HA and NA files are provided in FASTA format. These files contain the nucleotide sequences of the corresponding glycoprotein in different strains of individual influenza strains. These are needed for performing multiple sequence alignment.

HA_aligned.txt and NA_aligned.txt are the multiple alignment sequences of the FASTA files mentioned above. These are required for performing phylogenetic clustering.

all files ending in ".pdb" are the protein structures of the NA and HA glycoproteins. There should be eight. These arenobtained from the PDB website. They are needed for performing 3D structural bioinformatics method and 3D measurements.
